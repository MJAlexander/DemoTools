\title{Calculate Das Gupta's (1995) age sex accuracy index}
\usage{
ageSexAccuracyDasGupta(
  Males,
  Females,
  Age,
  ageMin = 0,
  ageMax = max(Age),
  OAG = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{Males}{numeric.  A vector of demographic counts in 5-year age groups for males.}

\item{Females}{numeric. A vector of demographic counts in 5-year age groups for females.}

\item{Age}{numeric. A vector of ages corresponding to the lower integer bound of the counts.}

\item{ageMin}{integer. The lowest age included in calculations. Default 0.}

\item{ageMax}{integer. The upper age bound used for calculations. Default \code{max(Age)}.}

\item{OAG}{logical. Whether or not the top age group is open. Default \code{TRUE}.}
}
\description{
Given population counts in 5-year age groups for males and females, follow Das Gupta's steps
to calculate a composite index of the quality of the age and sex structure for a given population.
}
\details{
It is assumed that the terminal age group is open, in which case it is ignored.
Set \code{OAG = FALSE} if the top age is indeed a closed interval that you want included in calculations.
If \code{ageMax == max(Age)} and \code{OAG} is \code{TRUE}, then \code{ageMax} gets decremented one age class.
